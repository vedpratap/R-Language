# R-Language
Personal Note

## What is RStudio ?
- It is a free, open source integrated environment or IDE for R (the statistical programming language).
- RStudio helps to keep R more organized and it adds more functionality to it.

```
 > x<-1:5        //Will create vector x having value 1 to 6 i.e 1 2 3 4 5
 > y<-6:10       //Will create vector y having value 1 to 6 i.e 6 7 8 9 10
 > plot(x,y)     //Will plot graph between x & y
 > ls()          //list all the variables in working memory.
```
- If we are using simple R console then we can export plots as a picture but with less functionality in comparison to RStudio (Using `Export`).

## Importing data in RStudio

- `Environment` - `Import Dataset` - `from local file` - `select Dataset` - `import` (We can modify while importing also)

## Create and Manage scripts in RStudio

- `File` - `New File` - `RScripts`
- Write some codes inside it and `Run` it.
- It will get executed inside `R` Console.
